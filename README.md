# builders-and-coders
A Python application designed for a Construction firm, Firm X, during COVID-19 where the Operations Manager requires an application to monitor the movements, attendance and overall wellbeing of his construction workers.

The functions are as follows:
1. Check worker attendance and health status
2. Keep track of project details
3. Dispatch and segregate workers 
4. Predict project completion rate based on prevailing COVID-19 conditions
5. Produces daily CSV reports

Read this before trying the application:
The program uses datetime and the excel file is generated everyday in the companyâ€™s point of view. The working file is edited based on the previous day's CSV.  However, as we were unable to predict when you would be trying/running the program, we are hence unable to give you the file with the right name from the get go. In a real life application, the manager is expected to update the app on a daily basis, hence there would be no need to find and rename the CSV, as a new one would be generated everyday. As such, we need you to rename the UpdatedProjProgress_Nov102020 file to T-1 date:
E.g. UpdatedProjProgress_Nov242020 if you are running the codes on the 25th of November
before running the program.
